# MasterCode-DSA-Bootcamp

Welcome to the **MasterCode DSA Bootcamp** repository! This project is aimed at helping learners master **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** through practical implementation and problem-solving exercises in **Java**. Each day, youâ€™ll find new coding exercises, implementations, and explanations of various DSA concepts.

---

## Purpose

The main goal of this bootcamp is to:
1. Build a strong foundation in data structures like **stacks, queues, linked lists**, and **deques**.
2. Provide **coding challenges** with solutions to help you practice daily and improve your problem-solving abilities.
3. Prepare for technical interviews by solving real-world DSA problems.

## Prerequisites

Before diving into the code, make sure you are familiar with:
- **Basic Java programming** concepts.
- Fundamental **data structures** such as arrays, stacks, and queues.
- Basic **algorithmic concepts** like recursion, sorting, and searching.

Having a basic understanding of these concepts will help you get the most out of this bootcamp.

## Project Structure

The repository is organized by **days**. Each day, a new problem or concept is covered, and a solution is provided in Java.

### Folder Structure:

### Day 1: [ Implement stack using array](Day1.java)
**Description**
- Learn the basics of the Stack data structure.
- Implementation of basic stack operations such as push(), pop(), peek(), and isEmpty().

### Day 2: [ Implement Queue using array](Day2.java)
**Description**
- 1. Enqueue: Add an element to the end of the queue.

- 3. Peek: Get the element at the front of the queue without removing it.
- 4. IsEmpty: Check if the queue is empty.

### Day 2-Q2: [ Lift Management System Using Queue and Deque](Day2_Q2.java)
**Description**
- 1. requestFloor(int requestedFloor): Validates the requested floor and adds it to the queue if valid, or  displays an error message if invalid.

- 2. processRequests(): Checks if there are any pending requests in the queue and processes them by moving the lift to each requested floor in order.

- 3. moveLift(int requestedFloor): Simulates the lift moving to the requested floor, updates the current floor, and notifies the user when the lift arrives.

- 5. displayStatus(): Displays the current floor of the lift and lists any pending requests in the queue.

- 6. main(String[] args): Initializes the lift system, provides a menu for user interactions, and handles user input for requesting floors, processing requests, and displaying status.

- 3. Peek: Returns the front element of the queue without removing it, checking if the queue is empty first.
- 4. isEmpty: Checks if the queue is empty by comparing the front and rear pointers.
- 5. isFull: Checks if the queue is full by determining if incrementing the rear pointer would make it equal to the front pointer.
- 6. Size: Returns the current number of elements in the queue by calculating the difference between front and rear pointers.

### Day 4-Qs1: [ Implement Stack Using Linked List](Day4_Qs1.java)
**Description**
- 1. Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack and increments the top pointer, checking for overflow.
- 2. Pop: Removes and returns the top element of the stack while decrementing the top pointer, checking for underflow.
- 3. Peek: Returns the top element of the stack without removing it, ensuring the stack is not empty first.
- 4. isEmpty: Checks if the stack is empty by verifying if the top pointer is at its initial position.
- 5. isFull: Checks if the stack is full by comparing the top pointer with the maximum stack size.
- 6. Size: Returns the current number of elements in the stack by adding one to the top pointer.

### Day 4-Qs2: [ Implement Circular Queue Using Linked List](Day4_Qs2.java)
**Description**

- 1. Enqueue: Adds an element to the rear of the circular queue and updates the rear pointer, wrapping around if necessary.
- 2. Dequeue: Removes and returns the front element of the circular queue while updating the front pointer, wrapping around if necessary.
- 3. Peek: Returns the front element of the circular queue without removing it, checking if the queue is empty first.
- 4. isEmpty: Checks if the circular queue is empty by comparing the front pointer to -1 or checking if both front and rear are equal.
- 5. isFull: Checks if the circular queue is full by determining if incrementing the rear pointer would equal the front pointer.
- 6. Size: Returns the current number of elements in the circular queue by calculating the difference between the front and rear pointers, considering wrapping around.

### Day 4-Qs4: [ Revese Linked List](Day4_Qs4.java)
**Description**
- 1. Base Case:
- If the list is empty (head == null) or has only one node (head.next == null), return the head.
- 2. Recursive Call:
- Recursively reverse the rest of the list (head.next).
- 3. Reverse the Current Node:
- After the recursion finishes, reverse the current node's pointer (head.next.next = head) to point it to itself.
- 4. Fix the next Pointer:
Set head.next = null to avoid circular references.
- 5. Return New Head:
Return the new head of the reversed list from the recursive function.

### Day 5-Qs1: [ binary tree operations](Day5_Qs1.java)
**Description**

- 1. Insert:
- Adds a node to the binary tree.
- The first insert method uses level-order traversal (inserting level-wise), while the second insert method adds nodes based on binary search tree (BST) properties (smaller values go left, larger values go right).
- 2. Traversal:
- Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right): Visits the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right): Visits the root first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root): Visits the left subtree, the right subtree, and finally the root.
- 3. Search:
- Searches for a specific value in the tree using recursion. If the value is found, it returns true; otherwise, false.
- 4. Find Minimum:
- Finds the minimum value in the tree by continuously traversing the left children.
- 5. Delete:
- Removes a node from the binary tree with three cases:
    - Node has no children (leaf node).
    - Node has one child.
    - Node has two children (replaces the node's value with the minimum value from the right subtree).
- 6. Height Calculation:
- Computes the height (maximum depth) of the binary tree.
- 7. Menu-driven program:
- The main method provides a user interface to select different operations (like insert, traversal, search, etc.) using a menu-driven approach.


### Day 6-Qs1: [ binary tree Delete operations](Day6_Qs1.java)
**Description**

- 1. Insert a Node:
- Prompts the user for a value and inserts it into the BST using the insert() method.
- 2. Delete a Node:
- Prompts the user for a value and deletes it from the BST using the delete() method.
- 3. Display Inorder Traversal:
- Performs an inorder traversal of the BST and displays the nodes in sorted order.
- 4. Exit:
- Exits the program.

### Day 6-Qs2: [ binary tree Delete operations](Day6_Qs2.java)
**Description**

- 1. Insert: node = insert(node, data) - Inserts a new node with the specified data into the AVL tree and rebalances it if necessary.

- 2. Delete: node = delete(root, data) - Removes the node with the specified data from the AVL tree and rebalances it if necessary.

- 3. Inorder Traversal: inorder(root) - Performs an inorder traversal of the tree and prints the node values in ascending order.

- 4. Preorder Traversal: preorder(root) - Performs a preorder traversal of the tree and prints the node values in root-left-right order.

- 5. Postorder Traversal: postorder(root) - Performs a postorder traversal of the tree and prints the node values in left-right-root order.
