### Day 5-Qs1: [ binary tree operations](Day5_Qs1.java)
**Description**

- 1. Insert:
- Adds a node to the binary tree.
- The first insert method uses level-order traversal (inserting level-wise), while the second insert method adds nodes based on binary search tree (BST) properties (smaller values go left, larger values go right).
- 2. Traversal:
- Inorder Traversal (Left, Root, Right): Visits the left subtree, then the root, and finally the right subtree.
- Preorder Traversal (Root, Left, Right): Visits the root first, then the left subtree, and finally the right subtree.
- Postorder Traversal (Left, Right, Root): Visits the left subtree, the right subtree, and finally the root.
- 3. Search:

- 4. Find Minimum:
- Finds the minimum value in the tree by continuously traversing the left children.
- 5. Delete:
- Removes a node from the binary tree with three cases:
    - Node has no children (leaf node).
    - Node has one child.
    - Node has two children (replaces the node's value with the minimum value from the right subtree).
- 6. Height Calculation:
- Computes the height (maximum depth) of the binary tree.

### Day 7-Qs5: [ Implement Kruskal's Algorithm](Day7_Qs5.java)
**Description**

1. Edge Representation: Each edge has a source, destination, and weight. We store all edges in an array.
2. Sorting: We sort the edges based on their weights in ascending order.
3. Union-Find: We use the Union-Find algorithm to check for cycles and ensure that no cycles are formed when adding edges to the MST.
4. Edge Selection: The algorithm selects edges in increasing order of weight and checks if they can be added to the MST without forming a cycle.
5. Subset Union: When an edge is added, we use the union operation to combine the sets of the two vertices connected by the edge.
6. Termination: The algorithm stops when the MST contains V-1 edges, where V is the number of vertices.

## File Search Application
### File Search Application: [ Final Project of DSA-Bo0tcamp](FinalProject.html)

**Description**

**Overview** 
* The File Search Application is a web-based tool that allows users to create and search for files in a virtual file system. The application uses a binary search algorithm to search for files efficiently and allows users to download files they create.


**Features** :
* Create Files: Users can create a new file by specifying a file path, file name, and file content. Once created, the file is immediately available for download.
* Search Files: Users can search for a file by entering its name. The application uses binary search to find the file quickly and displays the result

- Searching for a File

7. **Customization**
6. **Conclusion**

1. ### Technologies Used
* HTML5: For structuring the content of the application.
* CSS3: For styling the layout and elements of the page.
* JavaScript: For handling file creation, file searching, and user interactions.
* Blob API: To create downloadable files.
* Binary Search: To search files efficiently within the virtual file system.

2. ### How It Works
**File Creation**
- Users can specify a file path, file name, and file content.
- The application stores the file details in a virtual file list (files[] array).
- The file is made available for download using the Blob API. This API converts the file content into a downloadable format.
- The list of files is sorted alphabetically by file name using the localeCompare() method, ensuring efficient searching.

**File Search**
- Users can search for a file by entering the file name in the search bar.
- The search operation is performed using a binary search algorithm on the sorted array of file names. -This  ensures fast retrieval, especially when there are many files.
- If the file is found, the result is displayed showing the full file path and name. If not, the user is informed that the file was not found.

3. ### Binary Search Algorithm
- The binary search algorithm is used to search for files by name. It works as follows:

1. Compare the target file name with the middle element of the sorted file list.
2. If the middle element matches the target, the search is successful.
3. If the target file name is smaller, the search continues in the left half; if larger, the search continues in the right half.
4. The process repeats until the file is found or the search range is exhausted.

- This approach ensures a time complexity of O(log n), making the search operation efficient even with a large number of files

4.  ### Instructions

**Creating a File**
- Enter the file path: Specify where you want to store the file (e.g., /documents/myfolder/).
- Enter the file name: Choose a name for the file (e.g., myfile.txt).
- Enter the file content: Add the content you want the file to contain.
- Click "Create and Download File": This will create the file and automatically download it to your device.
- The file details (path and name) will be added to the virtual file system.

**Searching for a File**
- Enter the file name: Type the name of the file you want to search for.
- Click "Search": The application will perform a binary search and display whether the file was found or not.
- If found, the full file path will be displayed. If not, a "File not found" message will be shown.

5. ### Customization
- Styling: You can modify the appearance of the page by editing the CSS rules in the <style> block within the HTML.
- File Search Algorithm: If you wish to change how the file search works, you can replace the binary search algorithm with another search method (e.g., linear search).
- File Storage: Currently, the files are stored in a virtual array (files[]). You could enhance the application by storing the files in a backend server or local storage for persistence.

6. ### Conclusion
- The File Search Application demonstrates how to create and search for files in a virtual environment using basic web technologies and efficient searching algorithms like binary search. This application is a great example of how web technologies can be used to manage files and perform operations efficiently in a user-friendly interface.
